# Lights-Out-Game-Java
This is a game developed using JavaFx. Lights Out is a puzzle where the player is presented with an n-by-n grid of lights where some lights are on and some lights are off.  The object of the puzzle is to turn all lights off (i.e. "lights out").  We say that a light is toggled when it changes state, that is, off to on or on to off.  When a light is selected (i.e. pressed), that light and all lights immediately adjacent horizontally and vertically are toggled.  I worked on this game with my friend Connor Berson, as part of our Object Oriented Programming Assignment.
